# FreshEyes - Colorblindness Support in Chrome

FreshEyes was created as a contest entry for [CarlHacks 2014](https://carlhacks.devpost.com/submissions), where it took first place. The idea was created by the team after one member voiced interest in attempting to develop something based on colorblindness. Two team members had deuteranomaly, a color deficiency resulting in difficulty discerning red and green colors.
